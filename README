Server Instructions:

Usage:
./server <id> <listen_port> <servers_file> [is_primary]

id: The ID of this server process
listen port: The port number this server should listen on
servers_file: A file of ip:port pairs for the other servers in the cluster. For example, if you had three servers running on the same machine, and they listened on ports 10001, 10002, and 10003, the servers file of the first server would be
127.0.0.1:10002
127.0.0.1:10003

is_primary: Optional parameter. If any value is given for this parameter, the server starts as as the leader. If it is not given, it starts as a follower

Client Instructions:

./client <servers_file>

servers_file: A file of ip:port pairs for the other servers in the cluster. For example, if you had three servers running on the same machine, and they listened on ports 10001, 10002, and 10003, the servers file would be
127.0.0.1:10001
127.0.0.1:10002
